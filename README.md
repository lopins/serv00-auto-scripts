3. Then [create](https://lopins.github.io/serv00-auto-scripts/) a `Secret` named `ACCOUNTS_JSON`, set its value as the account and password string in JSON format, as follows:  

``` json
[  
  { "username": "qishihuang", "password": "zhanghao", "panelnum": "3" },  
  { "username": "zhaogao", "password": "daqinzhonggong", "panelnum": "1" },
